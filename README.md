## Description

This is a weather API project using vanilla JS/CSS. The purpose of this project was to solidify my API fetch and display skills; the API used for this weather app is https://api.openweathermap.org/. After completing this project I am confident in my ability to communicate with APIs and look forward to learning more in future projects.
